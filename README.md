# Why GLMPS?
GLMPS helps you find new music, by allowing you to quickly preview new albums the next time you go record shopping. Using advanced image processing techniques allows you to take a picture of an album and using Google's image search wizardry you can then listen to the tracks straight from that album, and save them for later.
