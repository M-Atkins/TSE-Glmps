Not all of these images will work, images 2,4,7,8,10.

Issues

-For example with image 7 and 8, there is a point that it incorrect. I need to implement something that will check the 4 points
making sure they are all close enough +/- 50 pixels roughly. And if one and only one is out of line it will be changed.

-When there are two shapes found, the smallest one needs to be deleted.

-Too much high contrast backgrounds or with a lot of dynamic range in lighting,
 will freak it out. Nothing can be done about this.
